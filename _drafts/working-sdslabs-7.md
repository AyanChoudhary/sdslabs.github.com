This post is seventh in the series of blog posts that we write every year to get the budding programmers of IITR acquainted with [SDSLabs](http://sdslabs.co). This is the fifth time we are recruiting since SDSLabs was founded. It is really tough to put down in a post how much I have gained being a part of this group, but I will try to.

##Introduction

For the past year, I have been part of an awesome student group in the campus named SDSLabs. Evaluating now, SDSLabs in all has become an intergal part of my life and identity. It has been eventful 308 days with a lot of things happening. Everyday, I have got to learn something new. While going through this journey, I have performed every possible role from a programmer to a manager. I have learnt so many things from various programming languages to different networking architecture in such a short span from fantastic people at lab.

##Timeline

In my first year, I was too excited to join lab. I gave the recruitment test but wasn't able to go through. But, I didn't lose hope as I was told by Abhishek Das that lab recruits people in 2nd year too, so I continued to program and learn other stuff on my own. After seeing Shashank Mehta's [blog post](/2014/01/how-to-join-sdslabs/) on 2nd year recruitment, I applied for an interview and luckily got through it. My initial few days were spent keeping up with stuff but everyone helper through it. The effect of lab was so prominent that my productivity and learning speed increased by 5 times. SDSLabs has also directly affected my coding style. It has made me a far better coder, introduced me to various design architecture. By the semster end, I was acting in managing part too. Till now, I haven't looked back, keeping myself constantly motivated and learning with help from everyone in lab.

##Learning Experience

I have learnt a tremendous amount of stuff at SDSLabs. When I entered, first I got to know about lab's internal architecture, this increased my knowledge of networking. Most importantly, every code/design/discussion on any project in lab was open to anyone, so you can just jump in and start contributing to any one of them. I contributed two small bug fixes to Codevillage, then further move on to rewrite the complete [Play](http://github.com/sdslabs/play) app (Lab's internal music player), including addition of some features. My first big project was [Experiences](http://experiences.sdslabs.co), this app had been into development for about 2 years. Many people had tried to complete it but no one was successful. It's code was in a messy state, but we were finally able to launch it this semster. I was on the main team who developed [JEE ranklist 2014](http://jee.sdslabs.co) along with [Ravi Kishore Rachuri](https://rkravi.com/), [Divij Bindlish](http://about.me/dvjbndlsh93) and [Dhaval Kapil](http://dhavalkapil.com). Further on the side by side I was working on addition of features to Muzi, which includes auto updation. Now I am working full time on it. During all this stuff, I got to learn many programming concepts and languages like Node.js, Go and Ruby.

##Inside Lab

###Work

Work culture in lab is just like that of a startup. There is lot of learning, hardwork, innovation and inventions. You can work on any kind of stuff you like. We have people who are proficient in many diverse fields from machine learning, networking to cryptography, disassembly. We discuss on every aspect of our work which include long talks on UI of a website to lab's architecture. We have regular lectures and talks on various new technologies around. We regularly discuss research papers every week. We are also into [open-source](http://github.com/sdslabs). Overall, twelve member from SDSLabs have cleared Google Summer of Code.

###People

You will find SDSLabs as a second home to you. If you have a topic to talk, you will surely find someone to discuss, whether it is upon CG, Electives, Anime, Earthquakes or even Biological Mutated Rats you will surely find someone. From juniors to seniors, everyone has something that you can learn. Fun filled sessions at lab are always productive.

###Technology

At SDSLabs, we use a plethora of technology. While most of lab projects are built upon PHP, MySQL and JavaScript stack, we have also explored many other areas. Many subprojects are built up in Node.js and Rails. Python is also extensively used for writing scripts. We are also experimenting with Go for the time being. We use [Slack](https://slack.com) and Google Groups to keep in touch. If you want more insight into how lab works go through [this post](/2012/12/how-does-sdslabs-work/).

###Fun

Fun is at the core of lab. From our own [bot](http://github.com/sdslabs/bot) to our human bot (Abhay Rana), everybody is fun-loving. We have regular chapos including the ones to Hometel and Dominos. We have our annual trip around February. We regularly participate in hackathons and other technical meetups around India. We watch movies together on our 42" LCD TV on beanbags. Come around at Srishti to have fun with the team.

##Recruitment

We are recruiting this January. Visit [join](http://join.sdslabs.co) for more information. Some points worth noting are:

- If you feel you are highly interested and motivated about app development, lab is the home for you.
- Try to find a bug in one of our applications, make sure to mention it in written exam.
- Willingness to learn is more important and above than CG, branch and techincal prowess.

Lab has become an important part of my life maybe it will become yours too. If you feel like lab is your place to be, just come and give our test.
