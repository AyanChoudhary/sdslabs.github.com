“What happens when you read some doc and either it doesn't answer your question  
or is demonstrably wrong? In Linux, you say 'Linux sucks' and go read the code.  
In Windows/Oracle/etc you say 'Windows sucks' and start banging your head against  
the wall." ~ Denis Vlasenko

Denis does a good job telling how much freedom Linux gives to its users. We as  
students do not want a bloated up, and slow system. We as students want to  build  
things quickly and get the best of whatever little resources we have.

When we planned the first meetup of Linux User Group, we did not expect that so  
many people would turn up.

The idea for a Linux User Group was given by Shobhit Singh,  
founder president of SDSLabs. The idea was to promote the use of open source  
soft-wares and open source development in the campus.

We wanted to introduce you to the Linux universe. Even without holding the majority  
of the market share, it has managed to immensely impact the technological progress  
we have made.

Abhay gave a kickstart to the event by introducing places like NASA, Google, Wikipedia,  
Facebook, Android, supercomputers which use Linux. Well, Linux won't be so popular with  
such cool tech giants if it was not awesome. This brings us to “Why YOU should use Linux?”

It's pretty obvious isn't it? What are the two most important things tech giants desire?  
Safety and speed. Linux gives you both. You can customize your computer to the extremes.  
For example, ArchLinux starts with just basics. When I say basic, it means just enough  
tools to let you install anything else. Everything else can be chosen by you.

Linux would be just like Windows to you if not for the power given by command line. Pramod,  
Pawan (IMG), Abhishek demonstrated various commands which totally eliminates the need  
for a mouse. That is time saving, isn't it?

The power of Linux lies in the command line environment. From the command line, you can  
play music, open up PDFs, write code, compile code, download, browse the web. That's  
pretty much the student life, isn't it? Ah well, you can also launch movie player  
through the terminal.

The best part of Linux is that it is Open Source. Whenever you want, you can add  
or improve a feature; whatever feature you want. Then you can feel blissful about  
helping someone through your code patch as you enjoy your cookies. Everything  
that is good, is free.

What next? Linux Installation Party! Join us on 4th September at Hobbies club, between 5 PM to 7 PM.
