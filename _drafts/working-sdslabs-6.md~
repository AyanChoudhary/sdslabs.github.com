What if you get a phone call that changes the way you see things, changes your schedule for the good and is the call you always awaited since you joined the campus? I got such a call, nearly a year back, "Congratulations! You've been selected in SDSLabs.". Since then, life has never been the same. As a member of SDSLabs one does not only groom one's programming skills but also unleashes the technological and entrepreneur acumen chained within oneself.

##The First Look

We had an introductory meet the very first day after our recruitments, my first informal acquaintance with the lab. Believe me, it was as if I am in some secret world, a technologically magical one, reliving the ‘Alice-in-wonderland’ moments!

##The Inside Story

Lab is a wonderful place to learn a lot of new things. We have some really cool brains at work 24x7 in here. Everyone is just so supportive. I still remember our starting days when we used to have problems with the smallest of issues, and had full support from the other members in solving them. f

Don't confuse it with being spoon-fed because that is something that will never be done. We're always instructed to find the solution ourselves, at least try really hard for the same, before asking someone for help. There couldn't be a better way to learn than this.

Want to know of the latest trends, tech events, innovations? Just step into the lab and be a keen listener, you'll learn a lot more than you can imagine. 
And if that isn’t enough for the ones willing to be a part of the conversation, all we say is ‘Join in, buddy!’.

##Activities and Work

Generally each of us is allotted some project under the mentorship of a senior, depending on one’s interests. I was given a team project where two of us had to develop a merchandise website that would deal in selling buying and exchanging goods and products. The app could not be launched though, due to certain issues we faced.

We have a history of organising events and open lectures, thus quenching the thirst for learning, of the enthusiastic developers. Continuing on our path, we this year organised some very successful events. The first in the series was the Linux User Group meet-up, which included an open lecture on the topic followed by a boot camp.
We had several open lectures on various topics like HTML, CSS and JS covered by us. We firmly and crazily believe that practice makes one perfect. And therefore we generally provide assignments to the attendees that are checked by us.

We are proud to have two of our members as the Google Students’ Ambassadors, representing the whole of the campus to none else, but Google. We have a small team assisting the GSAs in their activities. I am a member of the team, the Google Students Club, along with 4 other lab members. 

The GSC, lead by the GSAs, very successfully organised Syntax Error, the first hackathon of IITR, in association with Google and Github. We saw some very enthusiastic programmers from all the years, branches and programs.

Apart from all the functioning insight, one must definitely know about how technologically advanced the lab is. Among the proud possessions of the lab, a few are 42’ wide screen TV, Samsung tab, our own servers and the list goes on.


##Alumni Relations

Last but surely not the least are our seniors. We have a very supportive rich alumni base. Even though they've left the campus, they're still an integral part of the lab. Irrespective of their hectic schedule, they never fail to take part in each and every discussion, correcting us, suggesting changes, sharing their valuable experiences. We have always been directed towards the 'road not taken'.

Fascinated? Wait for more!

##The Fun Side

One may consider us a group where it's all about work. But hold on, we are a bunch of people who believe that one must work hard and party harder! We have frequent (you would have that word redefined by 'almost daily') chapos celebrating various causes and  victories. Did someone mention ‘The Trip’? Because that's where we let all hell break lose.

Personally, for me, SDSLabs is more than just a group. The bonds we share make one feel more at home. You can come to the lab anytime. Stay there. Code. Design. Brainstorm. Watch matches. Study. Sleep. 24 7.

Now after this little description  of the lab,  no doubt anyone would surely want to be a part of this tech-wonderland.
