title: Launching Experiences
excerpt: Dive into experiences of IITR alumni
---

Last month, we had our first launch of this semster: [Experiences](http://experiences.sdslabs.co).
After Erd≈ës, Experiences is our second application to be deployed on the internet thus accessible to anyone across the world.

Experiences is created with an effort to bridge a gap between current scholars and the alumni of the institute. We have curated a list of blog posts by IITR alumni from various streams, years and region. It uses Readability parser behind to fetch the right content from blogs of users. If you have a link for your blog post, experiences can have it's content.

We hope to see further active participation from alumni and students both to create a large pool of various experiences that they had at IIT Roorkee. If you want a post to be added to Experiences on your behalf, you can log into Experiences and add one or you can mail us with a link to your blogpost at contact@sdslabs.co.in.

## Technical Details
- Experiences has been in our kitchen for quite a while and needed a polish before launch
- PHP based backend using Limonade framework and JavaScript for DOM side manipulations.
- Readability API for parsing blog posts.
