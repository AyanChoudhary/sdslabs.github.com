title: Launching Experiences
excerpt: Dive into experiences of IITR alumni
---

Last month, we had our first launch of this semester: [Experiences](http://experiences.sdslabs.co).
After Erd≈ës, Experiences is our second application to be deployed on the internet thus accessible to anyone across the world.

Experiences is a collection of handwritten incidents witnessed by various different graduates who studied at IITR. It aims to guide as well as enlightne the new generation at IITR from already learnt skills.

Our institute currently features very little interaction between current scholars and the alumni of the institute. As such, there is a gap between Wthese two different realms. We have curated a list of blog posts by IITR alumni from various streams and years. We hope all this content can inspire a new generation of students to bridge that gap.

Experiences features a simple functionality to fetch content from existing blog posts. You just need to sign up and give us a link to your existing blog entry, and it will be quickly added to Experiences.

We hope to see further active participation from alumni and students both to create a large pool of various experiences that they had at IIT Roorkee. If you want a post to be added to Experiences on your behalf, you can log into Experiences and add one or you can mail us with a link to your blogpost at contact@sdslabs.co.in.

## Technical Details
- Experiences has been in our kitchen for quite a while and needed a polish before launch
- PHP based backend using Limonade framework and JavaScript for DOM side manipulations.
- Readability API for parsing blog posts.
