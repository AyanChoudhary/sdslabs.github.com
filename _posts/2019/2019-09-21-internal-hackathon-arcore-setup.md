Installing Unity is an easy task. Just download the setup files and after accepting all the agrements and defining the various things, it will install automatically and you are good to go. But the main problem comes when you want to do android development using unity.

Unity by default does not contain any SDK, JDK related to andrid development. So you have to install it by your own which is not easy as it seems as sdk manager in not available . For insatlling SDK, one can do two things:-
1. Install Android Studio
2. Install SDK command line tools

While the first method is quite easy. You jut have to install android studio and with it you get SDK manager which will download all th required SDKs. But wait... installing Android Studio... Not every computer has this much capable hardware which can run this heavy beast.

The second way is the hard way. It includes use of command line. The command line tool can be downloaded from https://developer.android.com/studio. After downloading, extract the zip file
