Along with this, we have also integrated *Campus Beats* Radio as well.

To start using the radio feature, just click on the Radio button in the topbar, choose a radio, and click on whatever you want to listen to.

##More Updates 
We have also updated our Hindi songs collection, and added album arts for all Hindi albums. A major color scheme change means that muzi is now easier to use than ever, with background album arts for various artists. Try clicking on "Avril Lavigne" to see it for yourself.
