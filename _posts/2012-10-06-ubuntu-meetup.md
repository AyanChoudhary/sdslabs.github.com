This blog post has been coming for some time now. The First ever Ubuntu Meetup was conducted on campus in collaboration with IMG. This was held to bring out the local linux user community to get together and talk about their lives in working with Open-Source . The main purpose behind the meet was to get a Ubuntu/Linux group started in the campus. We are happy to announce that, the meetup was a success, and was attended by more than 70 people, including the members of SDSLabs & IMG.

The meetup started with a brief presentation which outlined the various aspects of the ubuntu operating system and also listed the linux user group as open to all. A couple of seniors who've been roughing it out for a couple of years now shared the reasons that made them switch over to linux based Operating Systems. This included Vivek Prakash, Abhay Rana, and Giridaran Manivannan who talked of their own experiences in using Linux as their primary OS for the past few years.

The audience was mostly comprised of people who have already had their first bytes of Ubuntu. Almost everyone had some experience in using Ubuntu. In hindsight, this made the introductory aspects of linux that were discussed obsolete , but goes to show the linux user community is bigger than we initially imagined. This is definitely a sign that the campus is ready for advanced topics to be discussed in later meetings.

A [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lugiitr) has been setup for linux users in the campus, and it has already started showing some signs of life. Please join the google group if you're interested in learning more about Ubuntu/Linux. We're proud to have been a part of such a beginning.

Thanks to everyone who attended the meetup . Here's to many more such meetups in the future.

Cheers!
