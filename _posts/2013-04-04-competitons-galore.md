We were involved in organizing quite a few online competitions in March as part of Srishti and Cognizance. All of them occurred in the same week. This resulted in a highly hectic, but fun experience. Here’s a brief overview into the contests.

##backdoorCTF - A Jeopardy Style CTF Event

SDSLabs organised the first ever Capture the Flag event by IIT Roorkee from March 9th to 11th as a part of Cognizance, the technical festival of IIT Roorkee. The idea was proposed by Vaibhav Gautam from the Saharanpur Campus. CTF events are cyber security events which focus on a plethora of problems found in the real world. The event saw participation from contestants all over the world, with some really experienced hackers participating in the contest.

On our side, we had a lot of fun putting the event together. The event was great to host and we learnt as much the teams that participated. With mid terms ending on 4th, we had only 4 days to put the whole event together. We divided ourselves into groups based on categories of questions and got hacking. Three sleepless nights later, we had ourselves something to speak of.

There were some really nervous moments in the final 6 hours of the contest. The competition saw multiple leadeboard changes, with it ending in a nail biting finale where Team dcua (World Rank 15 on [CTFTime](//ctftime.org)) snatched the lead from team v3l0cityz3r0 in the final moments. Team h34dump (World Rank 46) brought up the rear, taking the third place. We are proud to add that Team v3l0cityz3r0 comprised of a student from IIT Roorkee amongst others. Our hearty congratulations to all the winners.

Not knowing what kind of participation to expect, the questions that we set varied across difficulty levels.The challenges for this CTF spanned from simple trivia questions to questions that required detailed knowledge of modern computer security techniques. We also held interactive discussion with the participants on the irc channel #backdoorctf.

In conclusion, we would like to congratulate all winners once again. We will be back with a bigger and better backdoorCTF next year.

##Codematics

Codematics is a Project Euler-style mathematical puzzle solving competition, held annually as part of Srishti, the Hobbies Club exhibition. It was organized by the Programming and Algorithm group, under SDSLabs.

The competition consisted of multiple levels of difficulty, with the challenges of a certain level only being accessible after the preceding levels had been completed. There was a wide variety of problems, and solving them required high mathematical and computational skills. Incidentally, the final problem did full justice to its name (beta, tumse na ho payega), and remained unsolved till the end of the competition.

The competition attracted widespread participation, with students from both outside the campus and within the campus participating. Archit Sachdeva (MCA 2nd year,IIT Delhi) was the overall winner, whereas Saurabh Paliwal (CS 3rd year) was the campus winner.

Credits to Mohammad Aqib, Purva Pruthi, Praneeth Reddy and Nitish Sharma for conducting the competition.

##Insomnia

Insomnia is IIT Roorkee’s annual algorithmic problem solving event, organized by the Programming and Algorithms group, SDS. Insomnia involves all kinds of algorithmic challenges, ranging from string manipulation to complex dynamic programming. It is the biggest online event in Cognizance, with participation from all over the world.

This year, Insomnia was held on SDSLabs’ very own app, CodeVillage, for the first time. It gave us a chance to step up CodeVillage from the intranet to the internet. Our homegrown code-checker, called ‘CodeRunner’ was used as the grader.

The competition saw some really great participation from all over the world. 8 out of the first 10 ranked teams were from outside India. Anton Lunyov, from Ukraine and flashmt from Singapore took ranks 1 and 2. ‘:P‘ (yes, that's their team name), a team comprising of Dipit Grover and Tarun Goyal won the campus prize.
