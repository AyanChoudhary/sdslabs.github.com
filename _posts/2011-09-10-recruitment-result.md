title: Recruitment Results for 1st Year
---

After much heartache and postponing of results, this is the final list. If you've not been selected, please don't be disheartened. If we did not select you, it was because we had limited vacancies, not because we didn't like you. Each of the rest was as equally likely and capable be to be selected. And each time we took someone’s name off the list, we were stricken with guilt. <!-- -**-END-**- --> There are so many with such great potential, and yet there’s no one to guide them. And that is exactly why we have lectures @sds. If you want to learn something, come to us, we are more than happy to help you any time.
