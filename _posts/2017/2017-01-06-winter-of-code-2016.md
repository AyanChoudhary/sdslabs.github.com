title: Winter of Code 2016 Results
excerpt: Winter of Code Results 2016
---

Winter of Code (WOC) was a month long program organized in IIT Roorkee for the first time by *SDSLabs* to improve the open source exposure in campus and help first yearites get a taste of open source community with a *GSoC* like timeline.

We got a great response from IITR Junta. *Cheers to all!*

From a staggering 100 submissions, 8 were chosen to continue their projects under the mentorship of SDSLabs members (GSoCers themselves). It was a great experience for us to mentor such an enthusiastic crowd. Their dedication, hard work and passion makes us believe that they have a bright future in this field.

After a hectic 30 days of coding and 5 days of rigorous evaluation, here we present the list of students who have successfully passed the final evaluation:

 - Vishal Sharma *(ECE)*
 - Vishwas Mittal *(CSE)*
 - Suyash Gupta *(EE)*
 - Suyash Mahar *(ECE)*
 - Yash Dev Lamba *(ECE)*
 - Deepesh Pathak *(ECE)*
 - Aviral Verma *(CSE)*

We wish them the very best of luck for their future endeavors.
Happy Coding!
