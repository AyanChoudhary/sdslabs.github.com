We're launching two new features today that we hope you'd like to use more and more:

1. [Lyrics in Muzi](https://sdslabs.co.in/muzi/) : This was a highly requested feature that took us some time to get to. We're glad we got it done, and we're glad at how it turned out. As of now, Muzi features lyrics for almost all english songs. We've pre-fetched the lyrics for all songs, which means that you don't need to wait for them, either. If lyrics for a song are available, you'd see a small "Lyrics" button in the control bar, which you can then use to browse the lyrics. We're thankful for all the feedback and requests for this feature, and hope we've implemented this well enough.

2. [Favorites in Filepanda](https://filepanda.sdslabs.co.in/favorites): We've implemented favorites in filepanda so that you can mark softwares as your favorites, and browse them later. This would help you to prepare your own list of softwares that you use, and check it easily, for instance.  
  
  You can favorite a software by going to its download page, and marking it as favorite. All favorites are listed on your "Favorites" page. The page is visible only to logged in users, so you will have to login before you can use this feature. This is a minor, but important feature in our plans for Filepanda. Stay tuned for more updates, because they are coming, and will bring many more such things.
