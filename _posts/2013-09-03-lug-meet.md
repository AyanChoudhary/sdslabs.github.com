excerpt: "The first introductory meet for Linux User Group was recently held jointly by IMG &amp; SDSLabs. Here's what all happened."

When we started IITR Linux Group a few years back there were about 5 people in 
it. Yes you read that right. The situation was pretty sad. All systems in 
Institue Computer Center run Windows, even most of the iMac's in IITR's library 
run Windows.

The numbers didn't really faze us though. We kept at it and now we are very 
happy to report a turnout of over 100 people for the first LUG meetup of this
 semester, conducted on 16th August. While the iMacs and other systems are still
 running Windows, we are sure we'll get there eventually and make our campus 
Linux friendly soon.

While we have pretty grand plans for LUG and the whole developer environment in
 IITR in general, we are aware that we'll have to take things slowly. Hence, the
 first meetup, which was targeted towards freshers, was mostly an introduction 
to the world of Linux. Abhay Rana of SDSLabs, popularly known as Capt. Nemo, 
gave a talk on who uses linux and why 'You' should use linux. The talk was well
 received, or so we hope!

The idea for a Linux User Group was given by Shobhit Singh, founder of SDSLabs.
 The idea was to promote the use of open source softwares and open source
development in the campus. The meeting was about  introducing IITR developers
 to the Linux universe. Much of the technological progress in the last decade
 has been brought about by Linux in various sectors; despite its small market
 share in the desktop market. (It rules in other markets, including Super
 Computers, Servers, and Mobile Devices)

Since the agenda was introduction to Linux, the meet wouldn't really have lived
 up to that if we had not introduced the saintly, the almighty, the great, 
TERMINAL! A team from IMG (Pramod & Pawan) went through the basic commands 
and tried to give an idea of what all can be done via the terminal _(basically 
everything)_. Then Abhishek Das of SDSLabs showed off his command line-fu. 
He 'cut' and 'grep'ped through a huge file containing all JEE ranks 
demonstrating the speed and ease of command line.

The talk and demonstration were followed by a small question answer session. 
SDSLabs members fielded a variety of "I can do this on windows too" questions.
 We are sure we managed to convince most of the people to atleast give Linux 
try. 

If you have any doubts about using Linux, please join us on our 
[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lugiitr), where we will 
be more than happy to help you out with your issues. Also, feedback is always 
welcome. Drop us a mail on <contact@sdslabs.co.in> or just post it in the 
LUG google group.

What's next? Linux Installation Party! Join us on 4th September at Hobbies club, 
between 5 PM to 7 PM.
