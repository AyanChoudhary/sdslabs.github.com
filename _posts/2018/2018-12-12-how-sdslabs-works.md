title: How SDSLabs works
excerpt: "An insight into the tools used inside SDSLabs"
---

SDSLabs is roughly run as two cells (programming/design) that collaborate with each other on everything. This blog post will take a look at the various tools, technologies, and applications that we use on a daily basis. It is our hope that some other groups in the campus might be interested in this. Weâ€™re open to inquiry about any of this, and you can reach us anytime at contact@sdslabs.co.in.

**Mailing List**: Our mailing list, like most other groups runs on Google Groups. This is our primary means of communication. We send out a heavy amount of email each day and email-overload is an actual problem for people who just join. All the notifications regarding discussion of projects or a general meetings are sent over the mailing list.

**Facebook Group**: Like everyone else, we too have our own facebook private group. Unlike most other groups, we hardly use it. We find the facebook notification system terrible, and the comments system broken for serious discussion. Hence we limit discussion on facebook to bakar, and taking jibes at each other. We also keep a document with our internal lingo here.

**Slack**: As a software development team, having around 50 members who work on various projects, need for a central chatting platform is a must. Every member is aware of the discussion going on, on every project and thus give inputs which are equally valued. We are completley transparent within. As a student group it is just not feasible for us to pay the hefty monthly fees for Slack premium but free version has got almost all the features we need, be it a number of integrations or infinite members.

**Hubot**:

**Presence**:

**Watchdog**:

**Dropbox**: Our designers primarily share all their work through dropbox. It is all continously synced with dropbox. All our designs, past and present have a place in dropbox. We also use it to share documents. A new Facebook feature for dropbox sharing within facebook groups was actually a real good helper for us as we use both products together.

**Github**: We host all our repositories on Github.

**Trello**: We use trello boards for keeping track of current status of a project.

**Workflowy**: We use a custom account at workflowy.com with a shared list to easily manage lots of things. It is an easy-going tool which we find useful for quick edits, lookups and at times when creating a google-doc. We find that the list system of workflowy is an excellent place to chalk out ideas and hold brainstorming sessions in writing easily. Workflowy keeps track of most of our administration related stuff, with tenders, management contacts etc stored there. A daily log of our changes on workflowy is forwarded to our google-group so everyone is kept in the loop about any changes made there.
