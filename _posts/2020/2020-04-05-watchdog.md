Access distribution is always a problem. You want an easy way to grant access to servers/instances to your organization members, but also want to ensure the security. We also need to ensure that the server which manages access is always live or you might end up being locked out of your server.

This problem was something we at SDSLabs faced too, hence we wrote a tool, which started as a couple of bash scripts but now is a Rust binary and is called Watchdog and the ever-live database is called Keyhouse.

## What is Keyhouse?

What do we do if we cannot ensure a database that is almost always live? Well, host your database as a GitHub repository ;) That's what we did, and have worked really very well.

The first thing to look at should be the structure of Keyhouse.

Let's have a look at Keyhouse.

To register yourself as a part of organization (and getting a username) add your SSH key to file `data/keys` in the format `name|ssh-key`. Make sure the name you choose doesn't collide with someone else's.

To gain access to user `study` in the server called `ratchet` we edit the file `data/hosts/ratchet` to add the line `name|study` in the bottom and open a pull request

 and get it merged by admin.

As simple as that! You got access to `study@ratchet`.
