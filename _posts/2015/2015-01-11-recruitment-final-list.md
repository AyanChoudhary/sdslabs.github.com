title: Final Recruitment List For 1st year (2015)
excerpt: The list of people selected after the long interviews.
---

We interviewed 75 people before selecting the final 13 programmers and 3 designers. It was a really tough job to filter down from the talented applicants to the final list. Sadly, we have limited vacancies and can only take in 13. But this is not the end of line for others, there's still a way to [join SDSLabs](/2014/01/how-to-join-sdslabs/). We'll continue taking open lectures on variety of topics. Stay connected with us on our Facebook [page](http://facebook.com/sdslabs) and [group](http://facebook.com/groups/sdswebdev) for the updates regarding this.
