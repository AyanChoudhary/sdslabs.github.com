Finally after after a night out and lots of head-banging over the preparation of shortlist, we have finally reached a consensus over the students to be interviewed. The following is the list of the shortlisted candidates along with their time slots.... Please arrive well before time.

<!-- -**-END-**- -->

But before peeking a look before we want to thank everyone who came to give the test. The enthusiasm of students for learning programming and coding stuff has really surprised us and further motivates us in our zeal to promote computational activities in campus. So while if any of you might not have been selected, don't lose heart!!! Feel free to approach us with any doubt you might have in this field. 

We will try our best to answer your queries. Plus as is the purpose of Software Development Section in Hobbies Club, we will carry on from where we left last semester and continue organizing lectures on broad ranging topics.
