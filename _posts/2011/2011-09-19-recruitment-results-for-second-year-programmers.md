For the list of selected designers, please see our previous post.

With more than 50 applications coming in from second year alone, it was very difficult for us to shortlist people. The shortlisting criteria was on what people had written down in their application form. Few people who were shortlisted were interviewed later as well; but we only had room enough for a few.

If your name is not on the list, please do not get disheartened, continue what you are doing. If your passion is programming, donâ€™t give up.
Learning is a continuous process, and it never stops as such. If you are still willing to learn, we are here to help you whenever you need it. Software Development Section, as an open proficiency under Hobbies Club tends to all such queries. Just join the google-group for this year. The group is open to all, whether or not you are a proficiency holder.

Congratulations to everyone who got selected.
