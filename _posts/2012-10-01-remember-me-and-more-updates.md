We've finally gotten around to launching one of the most asked for features, 'Remember Me'. This means that the you do not have to login every time you want to use our portal, and we'd keep you logged in for a long amount of time.

So now you can quickly solve a puzzle on Codematics, browse through your problem solution status on Codevillage, enjoy your Muzi playlists as well as Last.fm scrobbling all the time without having to login again and again. 

Speaking of Muzi, we've finally launched it on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apghjdamlhjnplhbahmebanbkceacmgn), so if you are using Google Chrome, you should check it out! We plan to improve it with a lot more features soon.
