excerpt: Filepanda new version brings a lot of new enhancements and a cleaner design
---
We are proud to announce the launch of the new version of [Filepanda](https://filepanda.sdslabs.co.in). This version brings a cleaner, modern layout to the forefront.

For this version, the most important goals were a better, faster UI, and an easier experience for the user. To this end, we've updated our homepage to show the top downloaded softwares for each category.

This version also rewrote a major version of the backend, fixing a few bugs in the process. If you had faced problems downloading certain softwares earlier, they have now been fixed.

The online version of filepanda has also been updated with the current version as well. You can browse the online version here.

As always, we welcome all feedback. Please send us your thoughts at our [feedback page](https://sdslabs.co.in/feedback/), by [email](contact@sdslabs.co.in), or [via Facebook](https://facebook.com/messages/SDSLabs). We shall be delighted to hear from you.
